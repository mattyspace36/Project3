Project3 - Supervised Integrated Video Streaming Application.

This school project involves the initialization of a VLC video stream from a bash script.
The stream shall be live via http protocol, and the quality must meet requirements for
regular HD with standard framerate(720p, 30 fps). This requires a minimum bitrate of 2500
kbps.

Along side the stream a TCPDUMP must be initiated for network observation.
